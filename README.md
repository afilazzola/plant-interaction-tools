# plant-interaction-tools
A series of functions used to making processing of plant interactions easier. As a community ecologist I am often stuck trying to find ways to compare the strength, frequency and sign of interactions among different plant species. The functions I have outlined here resemeble some of the more common techniques used to get estimates for comparisons between or among species. 
I am interested in hearing about new functions that are of interested to be added! I update this package regularly so feel free to contact me with any questions about it.
